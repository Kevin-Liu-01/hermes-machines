# agent-machines

> Bring any agent to any provider.

A multi-tenant rig that lets any signed-in user spin up a persistent agent on the cloud microVM provider of their choice. Pick **[Hermes](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent)** (Nous Research's self-improving agent) or **[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)** (Dedalus's open computer-use baseline). Plug in a key for **[Dedalus Machines](https://docs.dedaluslabs.ai/dcs)**, **Vercel Sandbox**, or **Fly Machines**. Get an OpenAI-compatible chat gateway, a per-user fleet view, persistent chat history + artifact storage on the user's own machine (under `~/.agent-machines/` on the persistent volume), scheduled cron automations, a 95-skill library, and the [Cursor TypeScript SDK](https://cursor.com/docs/sdk/typescript) wired in as an MCP tool so the agent can spawn real coding agents that inherit the rig's conventions as `.cursor/rules`.

## Shoutouts

Huge thanks to [`dedalus-labs/openclaw-demo`](https://github.com/dedalus-labs/openclaw-demo), [`dedalus-labs/openclaw-ddls`](https://github.com/dedalus-labs/openclaw-ddls), and [`AgentWings/hermes-agent-ddls`](https://github.com/AgentWings/hermes-agent-ddls) for the inspiration -- all three showed the path: provision a machine, install the agent, point it at Dedalus as the OpenAI provider. `agent-machines` grows that pattern into a multi-tenant deployment with the Cursor SDK as a delegation surface, a bundled skill library as the knowledge base, scheduled cron automations, a Reticle-styled chat UI, per-user persistent chat + artifact storage on each user's own machine disk, and a complete lifecycle CLI.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kevin-Liu-01/agent-machines
cd agent-machines
cp .env.example .env
# paste your DEDALUS_API_KEY into .env

npm install
npm run deploy
```

After ~6-10 minutes (most of which is `uv pip install hermes-agent`), you get:

```
  API URL:        https://<tunnel>.trycloudflare.com/v1
  API Key:        hp-<random>
  Dashboard:      https://<tunnel>.trycloudflare.com
  Machine ID:     dm-<id>

  Quick chat:     npm run chat -- "Say hi in one sentence."
```

Optional: set `CURSOR_API_KEY` in `.env` (from [cursor.com/dashboard/integrations](https://cursor.com/dashboard/integrations)) to enable the `cursor_agent` MCP tool -- without it the rest of the agent works fine, only delegating code work to a Cursor agent will fail with a clear error.

State is recorded in `.machine-state.json` (gitignored). Subsequent CLI commands reuse the same machine.

## CLI

```bash
npm run deploy             # provision (or wake) and bootstrap
npm run chat -- "msg"      # streaming single-turn chat
npm run status             # machine phase, port bindings, API health
npm run logs               # tail the gateway log (-- -n 200 for more)
npm run wake               # resume a sleeping machine
npm run sleep              # pause to save costs (state preserved)
npm run destroy -- --yes   # permanent delete
npm run shell              # print `dedalus ssh` invocation
npm run reload             # re-upload knowledge/ folder
npm run gc                 # destroy every machine on the org (use after `409 quota exceeded`)
```

## Web UI -- Next.js + Reticle/Sigil + Clerk-gated, multi-tenant dashboard

The `web/` app is the polished console for the rig. Public marketing landing at `/`; everything live (chat, skills browser, MCP browser, machine telemetry, the setup wizard) lives behind Clerk auth at `/dashboard/*`.

```bash
cd web
cp .env.local.example .env.local
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3210](http://localhost:3210). Sign in routes through Clerk; allowlist your email in the Clerk dashboard. The dashboard polls Dedalus and the Hermes gateway every five seconds for live state.

### Multi-tenant flow (PR1)

Every signed-in user owns their own agent. On first sign-in the dashboard surfaces a "Setup" entry with a yellow dot; clicking through the wizard captures the user's Dedalus API key, agent choice (Hermes or OpenClaw), provider (Dedalus today; Vercel Sandbox + Fly land in PR4), machine spec, and triggers a provision call. The resulting `machine_id` is saved to that user's Clerk private metadata, so every subsequent dashboard call resolves to their machine.

The project owner's Vercel env vars (`DEDALUS_API_KEY`, `HERMES_MACHINE_ID`, `HERMES_API_URL`, `HERMES_API_KEY`) become the fallback defaults -- so the existing single-tenant deploy keeps working unchanged for the owner, while fresh users provision their own machine end-to-end through the browser.

PR2 ships browser-driven bootstrap (the 12 install phases run from the wizard, not from a local `npm run deploy`). PR3 splits machine telemetry per user. PR4 adds the Vercel Sandbox and Fly providers behind the same `MachineProvider` interface.

### Required env vars

| Var | Where it lives | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Clerk dashboard -> API Keys | Auth -- public client key |
| `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | Clerk dashboard -> API Keys | Auth -- server secret |
| `DEDALUS_API_KEY` | optional fallback | owner-default Dedalus key when a user has none on file |
| `HERMES_MACHINE_ID` | optional fallback | owner-default machine for the project owner |
| `HERMES_API_URL` | optional fallback | owner-default gateway URL |
| `HERMES_API_KEY` | optional fallback | owner-default gateway bearer |
| `HERMES_MODEL` | optional | default model id surfaced in the wizard |

The four `HERMES_*` env vars and `DEDALUS_API_KEY` were required pre-PR1; in PR1 they're optional fallbacks. Each user can override them by completing `/dashboard/setup`.

For a Vercel deploy, set the Clerk vars; the rest are owner conveniences.

### Routes

| Route | Auth | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | public | marketing landing with hero, contribution grid, architecture diagram |
| `/sign-in` | public | Clerk sign-in card, redirects to `/dashboard` after success |
| `/dashboard` | gated | overview cards: machine status, gateway state, latency, counts |
| `/dashboard/setup` | gated | five-step wizard -- API key, agent, provider, spec, review, provisioned |
| `/dashboard/chat` | gated | streaming chat against the user's gateway |
| `/dashboard/skills` | gated | bundled skills grouped by category, click for full markdown |
| `/dashboard/skills/[slug]` | gated | rendered SKILL.md with metadata sidebar |
| `/dashboard/mcps` | gated | MCP servers + per-tool descriptions |
| `/dashboard/sessions` | gated | live SQLite session catalog from `~/.hermes/sessions/` |
| `/dashboard/logs` | gated | live tail of `~/.hermes/logs/*.log` |
| `/dashboard/cursor` | gated | live `~/.hermes/cursor-runs.jsonl` history |

### Agent switcher

The status header carries a `BrandMark` lockup (Dedalus x your agent) plus a dropdown that lets you swap agents. Hermes is the default (Nous Research's framework); OpenClaw is the other option (Dedalus's open computer-use baseline). Switching writes to your Clerk metadata; PR2 will trigger a SOUL.md rewrite + gateway restart on switch so the change lands immediately.

## What ships into the machine

`knowledge/` is tarballed and uploaded into `~/.hermes/` on every deploy.

```
knowledge/
├── SOUL.md          # persona -- direct, surgeon-not-painter, no emoji
├── USER.md          # operator profile -- placeholder; the agent fills this in
├── MEMORY.md        # what the agent knows about its environment
├── AGENTS.md        # operating principles (loaded into system prompt)
├── crons/
│   └── seed.json    # 4 cron jobs: health, digest, audit, consolidation
└── skills/
    ├── agent-ethos/SKILL.md
    ├── empirical-verification/SKILL.md
    ├── production-safety/SKILL.md
    ├── git-workflow/SKILL.md
    ├── frontend-design-taste/SKILL.md
    ├── reticle-design-system/SKILL.md
    ├── automation-cron/SKILL.md
    ├── security-audit/SKILL.md
    ├── computer-use/SKILL.md
    ├── plan-mode-review/SKILL.md
    ├── taste-output/SKILL.md
    ├── dedalus-machines/SKILL.md
    └── cursor-coding/SKILL.md
```

Replace these with your own opinions to retune the rig -- every file in `knowledge/` is just markdown.

Edit any of these and run `npm run reload` to push them onto the live machine without re-bootstrapping.

## Tools available to the agent

Hermes is configured with the full toolset. By default the agent can call:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `terminal` | shell commands inside the VM |
| `read_file`, `write_file`, `patch`, `search` | file ops |
| `web_search`, `web_extract` | search the web, scrape pages |
| `browser_navigate`, `browser_click`, `browser_type`, `browser_snapshot`, … | Playwright automation |
| `vision_analyze` | describe an image |
| `image_generate` | FLUX via FAL (requires `FAL_KEY` if you want this) |
| `tts` | text-to-speech (Edge TTS by default; ElevenLabs if keyed) |
| `execute_code` | sandboxed Python that can call other tools via RPC |
| `delegate_task` | spawn a subagent for parallel work |
| `cronjob` | create/list/edit/remove scheduled tasks |
| `skills_list`, `skill_view` | introspect the loaded skills |
| `memory` | read/update MEMORY.md and USER.md |
| `session_search` | FTS5 search over past sessions |

Plus four MCP tools from the bundled `cursor-bridge` (Cursor TypeScript SDK):

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `cursor_agent` | Spawn a Cursor coding agent against a working directory. Same model that runs in the Cursor IDE -- full file/terminal access, codebase semantic search, lints. Pass `load_skills: ["agent-ethos", "git-workflow", ...]` to inject Hermes skills as `.cursor/rules` for the run. |
| `cursor_resume` | Continue a previous Cursor agent by ID. Retains full conversation context. |
| `cursor_list_skills` | List local Hermes skills available for `load_skills` injection. |
| `cursor_models` | Enumerate models the configured `CURSOR_API_KEY` can use. |

The bridge is a Node MCP server at `mcp/cursor-bridge/`. It speaks stdio MCP to Hermes and the Cursor SDK to upstream. Auth via `CURSOR_API_KEY` in `~/.hermes/.env` ([cursor.com/dashboard/integrations](https://cursor.com/dashboard/integrations)).

When the user asks for actual code changes (refactor, bug fix, new feature), Hermes delegates: it doesn't write the diff itself, it calls `cursor_agent(prompt, working_dir, load_skills)`. The spawned Cursor agent inherits Hermes's conventions via the synthesized rule file and iterates with full tool access until the work is done.

## Lifecycle

Sleep / wake is the loop. Sleep stops per-second billing while preserving the persistent volume (`/home/machine`). Wake is fast (seconds) and re-runs bootstrap idempotently to repair any transient process drift (gateway, dashboard).

```bash
npm run sleep    # ↓ pause
npm run wake     # ↑ resume -- same skills, memory, sessions, port bindings
```

You only `npm run destroy` when you mean it.

## How it works

1. `src/cli.ts` dispatches to `src/commands/*`.
2. `commands/deploy.ts` finds-or-creates a machine via the Dedalus SDK, then runs the bootstrap pipeline.
3. `lib/bootstrap.ts` orchestrates 9 idempotent phases: apt deps, uv, hermes, seed knowledge, configure, seed crons, start gateway, start dashboard, mark version.
4. `lib/upload.ts` tarballs the `knowledge/` folder and base64-pipes it to the VM (heredocs are unreliable through the execution API).
5. `lib/exec.ts` wraps `client.machines.executions.create` with polling, timeouts, and structured errors.
6. `lib/api.ts` streams `/v1/chat/completions` SSE chunks for the CLI's `chat` command.
7. The `web/` Next.js app reads `HERMES_API_URL` + `HERMES_API_KEY` server-side and proxies `/api/chat` → upstream SSE so the bearer token never reaches the browser.

## Constraints discovered (so you don't have to)

- Heredocs (`cat << 'EOF'`) are unreliable through the execution API. Use base64 + `printf` for any multi-line content.
- The root filesystem is small (~2.4 GB, 60-70% used). Pin `HOME`, `UV_CACHE_DIR`, and the venv to `/home/machine` or installs `ENOSPC`.
- Guest agent needs ~5s after `phase=running` before the first exec succeeds (`503` otherwise).
- `hermes-agent` is **not on PyPI**; install via `uv pip install 'hermes-agent[web,mcp] @ git+https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent.git@main'`. The `[web]` extra is needed for `hermes dashboard` (FastAPI + uvicorn); `[mcp]` is needed for `mcp_servers` to actually load (without it, Hermes silently no-ops MCP support even when `hermes mcp list` shows servers as enabled).
- Hermes config keys: use `model.provider: custom`, `model.base_url`, `model.api_key`, and `model.default` (just the model name). The older `providers.openai.*` keys are silently ignored on current Hermes.
- Model slug for `model.default` must match Dedalus's catalog exactly. List via `curl https://api.dedaluslabs.ai/v1/models`. Use hyphenated slugs (`anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`), not dotted (`claude-sonnet-4.6`).
- The gateway only reads config at startup. Always restart it after `hermes config set`. We do this by killing the gateway via `ps + awk + xargs kill` (avoids `pkill -f` matching its own argv).
- `setsid foo & disown` doesn't fully detach inside the execution API. Use `(setsid ${launcher} </dev/null &>/dev/null &)` to push it into a subshell that exits immediately.
- Dedalus public previews require a hostname suffix configured at the org level. When unconfigured, the API returns 503; we fall back to a free Cloudflare quick tunnel (`*.trycloudflare.com`).
- Wake/sleep/admit/purge are gated by HMAC signing in the controlplane. The public Dedalus SDK doesn't sign, so a self-slept machine can't be woken via the SDK -- clear `.machine-state.json` and provision a fresh one (the bootstrap is idempotent and re-seeds knowledge from local files).
- The MCP subprocess inherits a minimal `PATH` from the gateway. Use absolute `/home/machine/node/bin/node` in `mcp_servers.<name>.command`, not bare `node`, or the bridge fails with `No such file or directory` even when the binary exists.
