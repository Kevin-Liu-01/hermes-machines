# Dedalus Machines (DCS)

This Hermes Agent runs inside a Dedalus Machine — a Firecracker microVM provisioned by Dedalus Cloud Services (DCS). Knowing how the runtime works lets me reason about my own state, costs, and recovery paths.

## Architecture summary

- Each machine is a microVM with isolated kernel, vCPU, memory, and disk. Process model: one Dedalus Hypervisor (DHV) process per machine.
- The host-agent exposes a ConnectRPC API on port 18080 that the controlplane uses to manage VMs.
- vCPU and memory hotplug is supported via ACPI GED + virtio-mem.
- Local migration uses fd passing over Unix sockets — sub-millisecond.
- Persistent storage is at `/home/machine` (this is what survives sleep/wake). Root filesystem resets on wake.

## Lifecycle phases

Reported in `machine.status.phase`:

| Phase | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `accepted` | Request accepted, scheduling. |
| `placement_pending` | Waiting for a host with capacity. |
| `starting` | VM is booting. |
| `running` | VM is up; guest agent is reachable. |
| `stopping` | Sleep in progress. |
| `sleeping` | VM hibernated; persistent volume preserved. |
| `destroying` | Permanent deletion in progress. |
| `destroyed` | Gone for good. |
| `failed` | Unrecoverable error; check `last_error`. |

Sleep ↔ wake is the cheap-mode loop. Sleep keeps state, wake is fast (seconds).

## Billing model

Per-second usage while awake. Storage charged monthly. Sleep stops the per-second charge but keeps the storage. Destroying a machine zeroes both. (Source: `docs/dcs/internals/billing-dedalus-machines.mdx`.)

```

Anything written elsewhere (e.g. `/tmp`, `/etc`) is gone after wake.

## Public surfaces

- **Port 8642**: Hermes API server, OpenAI-compatible. Reachable via Dedalus preview URL. Auth: bearer token = `API_SERVER_KEY` from `~/.hermes/.env`.
- **Port 9119**: Hermes web dashboard (FastAPI + React SPA). Reachable via Dedalus preview URL. `--insecure` because the dashboard does not require auth — only the API server does.
- **Port 18790** (optional): MCP server, if started.

## SDK touchpoints

If asked to provision a new machine or manage this one programmatically:

```typescript
import Dedalus from "dedalus-labs";

const client = new Dedalus({ xAPIKey: process.env.DEDALUS_API_KEY });

// Create
const m = await client.machines.create({ vcpu: 2, memory_mib: 4096, storage_gib: 20 });

// Run a command
const e = await client.machines.executions.create({
  machine_id: m.machine_id,
  command: ["/bin/bash", "-c", "uname -a"],
});

// Public preview
const p = await client.machines.previews.create({
  machine_id: m.machine_id,
  port: 8642,
  protocol: "http",
});
```

## Common operational issues

- `SSH_GUEST_CONNECT_FAILED` — guest sshd not yet ready. Retry after ~10s.
- `execution_runner_prepare_failed` — vsock path; retry. Persistent across machines means degraded environment.
- `ENOSPC` during install — root fs is small; redirect `HOME`, `UV_CACHE_DIR`, venv to `/home/machine`.
- `EADDRINUSE` on 8642 — duplicate gateway. `pkill -f 'hermes gateway' && /home/machine/start-gateway.sh`.
- `machine_not_routable` — sleeping or destroyed. Check phase first.
- `503` on first exec — wait 5s after `phase=running`.

## When the user asks me about this VM

Run `hermes doctor` first. Then check the gateway log (`tail ~/.hermes/logs/gateway.log`). Then check port bindings (`ss -tlnp`). Don't speculate — empirics first.
