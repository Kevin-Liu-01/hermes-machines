# Frontend Design Taste — Anti-Slop Framework

> Adapted from [tasteskill.dev](https://www.tasteskill.dev/) and Kevin's design wiki.
> For Sigil projects, also read `.cursor/rules/taste-enforcement.mdc` which enforces these rules at the Cursor level.

## The Problem

LLMs default to the center of their training data: Inter font, generic card grids, blue accent, minimal animation, centered hero, blur blobs. The fix is not better prompting — it is providing a real design system with tokens, variance dials, explicit creative direction, and hard-banned patterns.

## Variance Dials

Three numbers drive all downstream decisions. Defaults shown below — adapt dynamically based on user requests.

```
DESIGN_VARIANCE:  8  (1=Perfect Symmetry, 10=Artsy Chaos)
MOTION_INTENSITY: 6  (1=Static, 10=Cinematic)
VISUAL_DENSITY:   4  (1=Art Gallery, 10=Cockpit)
```

### DESIGN_VARIANCE
- **1-3**: Flexbox `justify-center`, strict 12-column symmetrical grids, equal paddings.
- **4-7**: Overlapping margins (`-mt-8`), varied image aspect ratios, left-aligned headers over center-aligned data.
- **8-10**: Masonry, CSS Grid with fractional units (`2fr 1fr 1fr`), massive empty zones (`pl-[20vw]`).
- **MOBILE OVERRIDE**: Levels 4-10 MUST collapse to single-column (`w-full px-4 py-8`) below `md:`.

### MOTION_INTENSITY
- **1-3**: No automatic animations. CSS `:hover` and `:active` only.
- **4-7**: Fluid CSS transitions with `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`. Cascade `animation-delay` for load-ins. Only `transform` and `opacity`.
- **8-10**: Scroll-triggered reveals, parallax, spring physics via Motion hooks. Never `window.addEventListener('scroll')`.

### VISUAL_DENSITY
- **1-3**: Art gallery. Huge section gaps. Expensive and clean.
- **4-7**: Standard web app spacing.
- **8-10**: Cockpit. Tiny paddings. No card boxes; `border-t` / `divide-y` only. `font-mono` for all numbers.

## Before Generating UI

1. Read `~/Documents/GitHub/my-wiki/wiki/design/design-system.md` for current tokens
2. Read `~/Documents/GitHub/my-wiki/wiki/design/aesthetic-systems.md` for archetypes
3. Choose an archetype (see below) before writing any component code
4. Lock the six style variables
5. If in a Sigil project: read `.cursor/rules/taste-enforcement.mdc`

## Five Archetypes

### 1. Premium AI B2B
Mood: confident, expensive, quiet, precise. Palette: warm white or carbon base, one deep accent, one signal color. Type: strong sans + restrained display + mono for labels. Motion: subtle reveals, one morphing hero motif.

### 2. Editorial Devtool
Mood: intelligent, technical, fast, exact. Palette: paper or off-black, one electrical accent. Type: sharp grotesk + mono for labels. Motion: layout reveals, crossfades, cursor/figure markers.

### 3. Architectural Blueprint
Mood: schematic, conceptual, exacting. Palette: off-white, deep ink, cobalt/cyan. Type: precise sans + mono annotations. Motion: line draws, panel reveals, depth via layering.

### 4. Cinematic 3D
Mood: immersive, sculpted, atmospheric, slower. Palette: shadow-heavy neutrals, two light temps max. Motion: camera drift, pointer parallax, idle loops.

### 5. Neo-Brutalist / Experimental
Mood: blunt, memorable, anti-corporate, loud. Palette: black/white + one aggressive accent. Motion: abrupt, fast transitions, type movement, no syrupy easing.

## Style Variables to Lock First

| Variable | Options |
|----------|---------|
| Contrast level | low / medium / high |
| Depth level | flat / layered / scene-led |
| Type voice | engineered / editorial / luxurious / brutal |
| Surface finish | paper / glass / metal / grain / plastic / shader |
| Motion appetite | restrained / assertive / theatrical |
| Density | open / balanced / packed |

## Banned Patterns (Hard Failures)

### Visual & Layout
- Centered hero + blur blobs (when DESIGN_VARIANCE > 4)
- 3 equal cards in a row for feature sections
- `h-screen` (use `min-h-[100dvh]`)
- Flexbox percentage math — use CSS Grid
- Neon/outer glows via default box-shadow
- Pure `#000000` for backgrounds or text
- Oversaturated accents
- Gradients with no material logic
- Glassmorphism on white for no reason
- Fake 3D from stacking drop shadows
- Pill buttons everywhere with no hierarchy
- Custom mouse cursors (outdated, hurts a11y)
- Excessive gradient text on large headers

### Typography
- Inter / Roboto / Open Sans as primary typeface
- Serif fonts on dashboards or software UI
- Oversized H1s that scream instead of communicating hierarchy
- More than three font families

### Content
- Generic names: "John Doe", "Sarah Chan", "Acme Corp"
- Generic avatars: SVG egg icons, Lucide user placeholders
- Fake round numbers: `99.99%`, `50%`, `1234567`
- Startup slop: "Nexus", "SmartFlow", "SynergyAI"
- AI clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen", "Game-changer", "Delve"
- Lorem ipsum in visible UI
- Emojis in code, markup, headings, or alt text
- Unsplash links — use `picsum.photos/seed/{context}/W/H`
- Generic Lucide/Feather icons — use Phosphor (Bold/Fill) or Radix

## Required UI States

Every interactive component must implement:

| State | Rule |
|-------|------|
| Loading | Skeletal loaders matching layout dimensions |
| Empty | Composed empty state explaining how to populate |
| Error | Inline error reporting |
| Active/Pressed | `-translate-y-[1px]` or `scale-[0.98]` tactile feedback |
| Hover | Meaningful change, not just opacity |

## Design Engineering Directives

### Typography
- **Display/Headlines**: `text-4xl md:text-6xl tracking-tighter leading-none`. Use `Geist`, `Outfit`, `Cabinet Grotesk`, or `Satoshi` for premium vibes.
- **Body**: `text-base text-[var(--s-text-secondary)] leading-relaxed max-w-[65ch]`.
- **Color**: Never absolute `#000000`. Use off-black via token `var(--s-text)`. Secondary text via `var(--s-text-muted)`.

### Color
- Max 1 accent color. Saturation < 80%.
- Stick to one palette for the entire output. No warm/cool gray mix within a project.
- In Sigil: all colors via `var(--s-*)` tokens, OKLCH authored.

### Materiality & Shadows
- Cards ONLY when elevation communicates hierarchy. When shadow is used, tint it to background hue.
- For VISUAL_DENSITY > 7: cards banned. Use `border-t`, `divide-y`, or negative space.

### Forms
- Label above input. Helper text optional. Error text below. `gap-2` between input blocks.

## Creative Proactivity (Anti-Slop Implementation)

### Liquid Glass (when glassmorphism IS justified)
Beyond `backdrop-blur`: add `border-white/10` inner border + `shadow-[inset_0_1px_0_rgba(255,255,255,0.1)]` for physical edge refraction.

### Magnetic Hover (MOTION_INTENSITY > 5)
Buttons pull toward cursor. NEVER use `useState`. Use Motion `useMotionValue` + `useTransform` outside the React render cycle.

### Perpetual Micro-Interactions (MOTION_INTENSITY > 5)
Breathing status dots, typewriter effects, float animations, shimmer, carousels. Spring physics always: `type: "spring", stiffness: 100, damping: 20`.

### Layout Transitions
Use Motion `layout` and `layoutId` for smooth reordering, resizing, shared element transitions.

### Staggered Orchestration
Never mount lists or grids instantly. `staggerChildren` (Motion) or CSS `animation-delay: calc(var(--index) * 80ms)`. Parent variants and children MUST be in the same Client Component tree.

## Creative Arsenal

Pull from these when building — never default to generic UI.

### Hero Variants
- Asymmetric: text left/right, background with stylistic fade
- Split screen 50/50
- Curtain reveal on scroll
- Text mask reveal (typography as window to video background)

### Navigation
- Mac OS Dock magnification
- Magnetic buttons
- Dynamic Island (pill that morphs for status)
- Mega menu reveal with stagger-fade
- Contextual radial menu at click coordinates

### Layout & Grids
- Bento Grid (asymmetric tiles)
- Masonry (staggered, no fixed row heights)
- Split screen scroll (halves sliding opposite on scroll)
- Horizontal scroll hijack

### Cards & Containers
- Parallax tilt card (3D tracking mouse)
- Spotlight border card (border illuminates under cursor)
- Holographic foil card (iridescent reflections on hover)
- Morphing modal (button expands into dialog)

### Scroll Animations
- Sticky scroll stack (cards stack over each other)
- Zoom parallax (background zooms with scroll)
- Scroll progress path (SVG draws as user scrolls)
- Locomotive scroll sequence (framerate tied to scrollbar)

### Typography Effects
- Kinetic marquee (text bands reverse on scroll)
- Text scramble effect (Matrix-style decode on load/hover)
- Circular text path (spinning)
- Gradient stroke animation

### Micro-Interactions
- Particle explosion button on success
- Skeleton shimmer loading
- Directional hover-aware button fill
- Ripple click effect
- Animated SVG line drawing
- Mesh gradient background

## Performance Guardrails

- **Hardware acceleration only.** Animate `transform` and `opacity`. Never `top`, `left`, `width`, `height`.
- **Grain/noise** on `fixed inset-0 pointer-events-none`, never scrolling containers.
- **Perpetual animations** isolated in `React.memo` `"use client"` leaf components.
- **`will-change: transform`** only on active animations, removed after.
- **Z-index**: systemic layers only (navbar, modal, overlay).
- **useEffect cleanup**: every animation effect returns a cleanup function.
- **Scroll**: `IntersectionObserver`, never `window.addEventListener('scroll')`.
- **Never mix GSAP/Three.js with Motion** in the same component tree. Motion for UI; GSAP/Three for isolated scroll sequences or canvas backgrounds.

## Dependency Verification

Before importing ANY library, check `package.json`. If missing, output the install command before providing code.

## RSC Safety

- Default to Server Components.
- Interactive UI extracted as `"use client"` leaf components.
- Check Tailwind version in `package.json` — don't use v4 syntax in v3.
- For v4: `@tailwindcss/postcss` or Vite plugin, never `tailwindcss` in `postcss.config.js`.

## Output Completeness

Every generation is production-critical. Banned:
- `// ...`, `// rest of code`, `// TODO`, `// implement here`
- "Let me know if you want me to continue", "for brevity"
- Skeletons when full implementation was requested

When approaching limits, write at full quality to a clean breakpoint:
```
[PAUSED — X of Y complete. Send "continue" to resume from: next section]
```

## Token Architecture (for Sigil projects)

Three layers: **primitive** (`color.gray.950`, `space.4`), **semantic** (`color.surface.page`, `motion.duration.fast`), **component** (only when needed: `button.primary.bg`).

Transport: Tailwind CSS v4 `@theme` + runtime CSS variables + OKLCH.

All visual properties MUST reference `var(--s-*)` tokens. Hardcoded hex, px, font names, shadow classes, and duration values are banned.

## Frontier Stack 2026

| Layer | Tool |
|-------|------|
| Tokens & styling | Tailwind CSS v4 `@theme`, OKLCH |
| Component motion | Motion (Framer Motion) |
| Scroll storytelling | GSAP + ScrollTrigger |
| 3D scenes | React Three Fiber + drei |
| Shader-first | OGL, custom GLSL/WGSL |
| App transitions | React `startTransition`, `<ViewTransition>` |

## Workflow

1. Choose archetype from the five above
2. Lock the six style variables
3. Set variance dials (or accept defaults: 8, 6, 4)
4. Define/verify tokens (primitive → semantic → component)
5. Provide: archetype name, token file, 2-3 reference URLs, explicit anti-patterns
6. Build components. The direction compounds.
