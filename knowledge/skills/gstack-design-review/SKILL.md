# Design Review — Audit, Fix, Verify

Adapted from GStack v0.17.0.0 by Garry Tan. Uses agent-browser instead of
GStack's `$B` commands. UX principles from Steve Krug's "Don't Make Me Think."

## Contract

This skill guarantees:
- Structured design audit with letter grades (A-F) across 10 categories
- AI Slop Score as standalone headline metric
- 6 usability tests on every page (Trunk Test, 3-Second Scan, Page Area Test, Happy Talk Detection, Mindless Choice Audit, Goodwill Reservoir)
- First-person narration mode (anti-slop: if you can't name the specific element, you're generating platitudes)
- Before/after screenshots for every fix
- One atomic commit per fix
- Findings sorted by impact (High > Medium > Polish)

## UX Principles: How Users Actually Behave

### The Three Laws of Usability

1. **Don't make me think.** Every page should be self-evident. If a user stops to think "What do I click?" — the design has failed.
2. **Clicks don't matter, thinking does.** Three mindless, unambiguous clicks beat one click that requires thought.
3. **Omit, then omit again.** Get rid of half the words on each page, then get rid of half of what's left. Happy talk must die. Instructions must die.

### How Users Actually Behave

- **Users scan, they don't read.** Design for scanning: visual hierarchy, clearly defined areas, headings and bullet lists, highlighted key terms. We're designing billboards at 60 mph.
- **Users satisfice.** They pick the first reasonable option, not the best. Make the right choice the most visible choice.
- **Users muddle through.** They don't figure out how things work. They wing it.
- **Users don't read instructions.** Guidance must be brief, timely, and unavoidable.

### Billboard Design for Interfaces

- **Use conventions.** Logo top-left, nav top/left, search = magnifying glass. Don't innovate on navigation to be clever.
- **Visual hierarchy is everything.** More important = more prominent. If everything shouts, nothing is heard.
- **Make clickable things obviously clickable.** No relying on hover states for discoverability.
- **Eliminate noise.** Fix noise by removal, not addition.
- **Clarity trumps consistency.**

### Navigation as Wayfinding

Users on the web have no sense of scale, direction, or location. Navigation must always answer: What site is this? What page am I on? What are the major sections? What are my options at this level? Where am I? How can I search?

### The Goodwill Reservoir

Users start with a reservoir of goodwill. Every friction point depletes it.

**Deplete faster:** Hiding info users want. Punishing users for not doing things your way. Asking for unnecessary information. Putting sizzle in their way. Unprofessional appearance.

**Replenish:** Know what users want and make it obvious. Tell them what they want to know upfront. Save them steps. Make it easy to recover from errors.

## Phases

### Phase 1: First Impression

Navigate to the target URL. Take a screenshot.

```bash
agent-browser snapshot <url> --output first-impression.png
```

Write the first impression in **first-person narration mode**:
- "The site communicates **[what]**."
- "I notice **[observation]**."
- "The first 3 things my eye goes to are: **[1]**, **[2]**, **[3]**."
- "If I had to describe this in one word: **[word]**."

**Page Area Test:** Point at each clearly defined area. Can you instantly name its purpose? Areas you can't name in 2 seconds are poorly defined.

### Phase 2: Design System Extraction

Extract the actual design system rendered on the page (not what a config says):
- **Fonts:** list with usage counts. Flag if >3 distinct families.
- **Colors:** palette. Flag if >12 unique non-gray colors.
- **Heading Scale:** h1-h6 sizes. Flag skipped levels.
- **Spacing Patterns:** sample padding/margin values.

### Phase 3: Page-by-Page Visual Audit

For each page in scope, run the **Trunk Test**:
1. What site is this? (Site ID visible)
2. What page am I on? (Page name prominent)
3. What are the major sections? (Nav visible and clear)
4. What are my options at this level? (Local nav obvious)
5. Where am I in the scheme of things? (Breadcrumbs, "you are here")
6. How can I search?

Score: PASS (all 6) / PARTIAL (4-5) / FAIL (3 or fewer). A FAIL is HIGH-impact.

Then apply the **10-Category Checklist (~80 items)**:

1. **Visual Hierarchy & Composition** (8 items) — focal point, eye flow, visual noise, information density, above-the-fold purpose, squint test, white space
2. **Typography** (15 items) — font count <=3, scale ratio, line-height, measure 45-75 chars, heading hierarchy, weight contrast, no blacklisted fonts, flag generic (Inter/Roboto), text-wrap balance, tabular-nums on number columns, body >=16px
3. **Color & Contrast** (10 items) — palette coherent <=12 colors, WCAG AA (4.5:1 body, 3:1 large), semantic consistency, no color-only encoding, dark mode elevation
4. **Spacing & Layout** (12 items) — grid consistent, 4/8px scale, alignment, rhythm, concentric border-radius, no horizontal scroll, max content width, safe-area-inset
5. **Interaction States** (10 items) — hover, focus-visible, active/pressed, disabled, loading skeletons, empty states, error messages, touch targets >=44px, mindless choice audit
6. **Responsive Design** (8 items) — mobile layout makes design sense, touch targets, no horizontal scroll, images responsive, text readable without zoom, nav collapses
7. **Motion & Animation** (6 items) — ease-out for entering / ease-in for exiting, 50-700ms duration, every animation communicates something, prefers-reduced-motion, no transition:all
8. **Content & Microcopy** (8 items) — empty states designed, error messages specific, button labels specific, no lorem ipsum, happy talk detection with word count, instructions detection
9. **AI Slop Detection** (10 anti-patterns) — purple gradients, 3-column feature grid, icons in colored circles, centered everything, uniform bubbly radius, decorative blobs, emoji as design, colored left-border cards, generic hero copy, cookie-cutter section rhythm
10. **Performance as Design** (6 items) — LCP <2.0s, CLS <0.1, skeleton quality, image optimization, font-display swap, no FOUT

### Phase 4: Interaction Flow Review

Walk 2-3 key user flows in first-person narration mode.

**Goodwill Reservoir tracking** (start at 70/100):
- Hidden information: -15
- Format punishment: -10
- Unnecessary info requests: -10
- Interstitials blocking task: -15
- Sloppy appearance: -10
- Ambiguous choices requiring thought: -5 each
- Obvious top tasks: +10
- Upfront about costs: +5
- Saves steps: +5 each
- Graceful error recovery: +10

Report with visual dashboard. Below 30 = critical UX debt.

### Phase 5: Cross-Page Consistency

Compare across pages: nav consistent? Footer consistent? Component reuse? Tone consistency? Spacing rhythm?

### Phase 6: Compile Report

**Dual headline scores:**
- Design Score: A-F (weighted average of 10 categories)
- AI Slop Score: A-F (standalone)

**Category weights:** Visual Hierarchy 15%, Typography 15%, Spacing 15%, Color 10%, Interactions 10%, Responsive 10%, Content 10%, AI Slop 5%, Motion 5%, Performance 5%.

**Grade computation:** Start at A. Each High-impact finding drops one letter. Each Medium drops half a letter. Polish findings noted but don't affect grade.

## Fix Loop

For each fixable finding, in impact order:
1. Locate source files
2. Make the minimal fix (CSS-first, smallest change)
3. One commit per fix: `style(design): FINDING-NNN — short description`
4. Re-test and take after screenshot
5. Classify: verified / best-effort / reverted / deferred

**Hard cap:** 30 fixes. After 30, stop regardless. Self-regulate every 5 fixes.

## Anti-Patterns

- Generating platitudes instead of naming specific elements
- Fixing things without before/after screenshots
- Bundling multiple fixes into one commit
- Refactoring unrelated code while fixing design issues
- Evaluating source code instead of the rendered site
- Skipping the Trunk Test or Goodwill Reservoir tracking
