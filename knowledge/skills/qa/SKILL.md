# QA — Test, Find Bugs, Fix, Verify

Adapted from GStack by Garry Tan. You are a QA lead testing a real application
in a real browser. You find bugs, fix them, generate regression tests, and verify.

## Contract

This skill guarantees:
- Real browser testing via agent-browser (Lightpanda default, Chrome for auth)
- Every bug found has a reproduction path with screenshots
- Fixes are atomic (one commit per bug)
- Every fix generates a regression test
- Tests run and pass before the fix is committed
- Commit format: `fix(qa): BUG-NNN — description`
- Test commit format: `test(qa): regression test for BUG-NNN`

## Phases

### Phase 1: Discover the App

```bash
agent-browser snapshot <url>
```

Understand the app:
- What is this? (Marketing site, dashboard, SaaS app, docs site)
- What are the key user flows?
- What's the tech stack? (Check page source, framework indicators)
- Is auth required? (If redirected to login, ask Kevin for credentials or use `--engine chrome --profile` for existing session)

### Phase 2: Test Key Flows

Walk through 3-5 key user flows. For each:

1. **Navigate** to the starting point
2. **Screenshot** the initial state
3. **Interact** — click buttons, fill forms, navigate
4. **Observe** — check for:
   - Console errors (`agent-browser console --errors`)
   - Visual glitches (overlapping elements, broken layouts)
   - Functional failures (buttons that don't work, forms that don't submit)
   - Loading states (missing spinners, infinite loading)
   - Error handling (what happens when things go wrong?)
   - Responsive behavior (test at 375px, 768px, 1440px)
5. **Screenshot** the result of each interaction

### Phase 3: Bug Report

For each bug found:

```
BUG-NNN: {title}
=================
Severity: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
Flow: {which user flow}
Steps to reproduce:
  1. Navigate to {url}
  2. Click {element}
  3. Observe {behavior}
Expected: {what should happen}
Actual: {what actually happens}
Screenshot: {path}
Console errors: {if any}
```

### Phase 4: Fix Loop

For each fixable bug, in severity order:

1. **Locate source** — find the file responsible
2. **Fix** — make the minimal change that resolves the bug
3. **Write regression test** — test encodes the exact bug condition:
   - Study existing test patterns in the repo first
   - Match the existing test framework (Vitest, Jest, Playwright, etc.)
   - Test the specific scenario that triggered the bug
   - Test should fail without the fix and pass with it
4. **Run tests** — verify all tests pass (existing + new)
5. **Commit fix**: `fix(qa): BUG-NNN — description`
6. **Commit test**: `test(qa): regression test for BUG-NNN`
7. **Re-test in browser** — navigate back and verify the fix

### Phase 5: Responsive Testing

For each key page, test at three viewports:

```bash
agent-browser snapshot <url> --viewport 375x812    # mobile
agent-browser snapshot <url> --viewport 768x1024   # tablet
agent-browser snapshot <url> --viewport 1440x900   # desktop
```

Check:
- Layout breaks at each viewport?
- Touch targets >=44px on mobile?
- Horizontal scroll on any viewport?
- Navigation collapses appropriately?
- Text readable without zooming?

### Phase 6: Compile Report

```
QA REPORT: {app name}
=====================
URL: {url}
Flows tested: N
Bugs found: N (Critical: X, High: Y, Medium: Z, Low: W)
Bugs fixed: N
Regression tests written: N

BUG-001: [CRITICAL] {title} — FIXED (commit: abc1234)
BUG-002: [HIGH] {title} — FIXED (commit: def5678)
BUG-003: [MEDIUM] {title} — DEFERRED (reason)

Responsive: {PASS / ISSUES at mobile / ISSUES at tablet}

Verdict: SHIP / FIX FIRST / NEEDS DISCUSSION
```

## Self-Regulation

Every 5 fixes, evaluate:
- Am I still fixing real bugs or nitpicking?
- Have any fixes introduced new issues?
- Is the risk level acceptable?

**Hard cap:** 15 bug fixes. After 15, stop and report.

## Anti-Patterns

- Testing without taking screenshots (no evidence)
- Fixing bugs without regression tests
- Bundling multiple bug fixes into one commit
- Testing only the happy path
- Skipping responsive testing
- Fixing design issues in a QA pass (that's design-review's job)
- Testing with developer tools open (users don't have dev tools)
