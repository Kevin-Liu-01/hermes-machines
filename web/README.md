# Agent Machines Web

Next.js 15 + Tailwind v4 public site and Clerk-gated dashboard for `agent-machines`.

The web app does three jobs:

- Public marketing/docs: landing page, architecture map, FAQ, terms, privacy.
- Authenticated control plane: setup, machines, chat, loadout, skills, MCPs, sessions, logs, Cursor runs, artifacts.
- Server-side gateway proxy: browser chat calls go through API routes so machine bearers never become `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values.

## Current status

- Dedalus Machines is the only provider wired end-to-end today.
- Vercel Sandbox and Fly Machines exist in the provider contract and setup UI, but their provider implementations return `not_supported`.
- `/dashboard/setup` stores provider credentials and can create a provider machine record.
- Browser-driven agent bootstrap is not wired yet. Use the root CLI to install Hermes/OpenClaw, then save the gateway URL/key from `/dashboard/machines`.
- Cursor is optional. `cursor-bridge` only activates when a Cursor API key is present.

## Quick start

```bash
cd web
cp .env.local.example .env.local
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3210>.

For authenticated routes, configure Clerk:

```txt
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=...
```

Optional owner fallback env vars:

```txt
DEDALUS_API_KEY=...
HERMES_MACHINE_ID=...
HERMES_API_URL=...
HERMES_API_KEY=...
HERMES_MODEL=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
```

## Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # sync skills, start Next on :3210
npm run build        # sync skills, build
npm run typecheck    # sync skills, tsc --noEmit
npm run sync-skills  # regenerate data/skills.json from ../knowledge/skills
```

## Public routes

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/` | landing page with hero, capabilities, runtime visuals, loadout, skills, architecture |
| `/faq` | product FAQ backed by `lib/seo/config.ts` |
| `/terms` | terms of service |
| `/privacy` | privacy policy |
| `/sign-in` | Clerk sign-in |
| `/onboarding` | first-run flow |

## Dashboard routes

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/dashboard` | overview |
| `/dashboard/setup` | credentials, agent, provider, spec, review |
| `/dashboard/machines` | machine fleet, active machine, gateway credentials |
| `/dashboard/chat` | streaming chat through the active gateway |
| `/dashboard/loadout` | built-ins, service hierarchy, task hierarchy |
| `/dashboard/skills` | synced SKILL.md library |
| `/dashboard/mcps` | MCP servers and tools |
| `/dashboard/sessions` | Hermes session DB inventory |
| `/dashboard/logs` | gateway log tail |
| `/dashboard/cursor` | cursor-bridge run history |
| `/dashboard/artifacts` | machine artifact storage |

## Data boundaries

- Clerk private metadata stores provider keys, Cursor key, gateway bearers, and full `UserConfig`.
- Clerk public metadata only exposes redacted setup and machine state.
- Machine product data lives under `/home/machine/.agent-machines/`.
- Hermes runtime data lives under `/home/machine/.hermes/`.
- The VM repo checkout lives at `/home/machine/hermes-machines/` and is only used for reloads.

These paths are deliberately separate. `~/.hermes` is not the app data root. `/home/machine/hermes-machines` is not the Hermes runtime. Tiny naming mines, neatly flagged. Horrifying, but flagged.

## Design notes

The UI uses the Reticle/Sigil system: visible rails, hairline borders, hatching, cross marks, Nacelle for UI text, Geist Mono for machine data, and Instrument Serif only for the wordmark. Keep public copy direct and operational. If a provider is shaped but not wired, say that plainly.
